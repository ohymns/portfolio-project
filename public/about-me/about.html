    <h3>Photographer and aspiring Interaction Designer</h3>
    <p class="main-text"><br> I'm Olivia, a 20-year-old photographer and designer from Oslo, Norway,<br>
         now making my mark in Berlin, Germany. <br> Since I could first hold a camera,
          my lens has been drawn to human interactions and fleeting moments, <br> capturing stories
           in every frame. <br> <br>
           With a media and communication degree and A-levels in Photography and Media Studies,<br>
         Olivia's academic journey laid the foundation for my artistic pursuits. <br>
          Following a year of photography seminars, she showcased my work at Henie Onstad Art Centre,<br>
           solidifying my presence in the art world. <br>
        
        Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Interaction Design at Code University, <br>
         Olivia merges my passion for photography with innovative design principles, <br>
          exploring the intersection of technology and human connection.
        
        Eager for new adventures and challenges in photography, videography, and design, <br>
         Olivia's creativity knows no bounds. <br>
          Each click of my shutter invites you to join my on my journey <br>
           of discovery through the captivating landscapes <br>
            of human emotion and interaction.
